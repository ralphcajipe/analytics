# <b> Data Analysis Study Guide </b>

Welcome to the data analysis study guide! As a beginner, this guide will provide you with the resources you need to get started with data analysis.

To get started with your data analysis, please install the following:

1. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook) (lightweight)

2. [JetBrains DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/) - this tool will assist you with the GitHub Copilot extension. Please make sure to install Copilot from the extensions menu after installation.

By installing these tools, you'll have everything you need to start analyzing data efficiently and effectively. 

You will learn from Nicholas Renotte's fast YouTube courses, a Data Science Specialist at IBM and a Coursera course with hands-on project.

## <b> Course 1: Pandas for Data Science in 20 Minutes | Python Crash Course </b> 
In this crash course, you'll learn the basics of Pandas, one of the most widely used data analysis libraries in Python. This course will teach you the 20% of Pandas you need to know to get 80% of the results.
